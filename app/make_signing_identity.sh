# Creates the self-made code signing certificate "QuickScribe Release", once,
# so every release build is signed by the SAME identity and macOS recognizes
# updates as the same app instead of a stranger.
#
# - Nothing to do if the certificate already exists. Run it once; it never
#   makes a second one.
# - The private key goes into the keychain and nowhere else: the intermediate
#   files live in a private temporary folder destroyed on the way out.
# - The certificate says only "QuickScribe Release". No name, no email, no
#   machine. It is self-made, so it removes nothing of the first-open block;
#   only Apple's paid program does that. It costs nothing.
# - Trust settings stay untouched: signing is work the key does, not a
#   judgment macOS is asked to make. Nothing here changes system trust.
#
# Target: the login keychain, or a keychain file passed as the first argument
# (that is how the script itself gets tested, on a throwaway keychain).
