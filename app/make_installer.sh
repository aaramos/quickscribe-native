Installing ${APP_NAME}

What it needs, before you start:
- An Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 27
- Apple Intelligence turned on, for the AI cleanup. Dictation still works without it,
  with only the basic tidy-up.

1. Drag ${APP_NAME} to Applications.
2. Open it from Applications. macOS will block it the first time: this app is free and
   open source, and it is not signed with a paid Apple Developer ID, so macOS cannot
   check who made it. That block is macOS doing its job. Then open System Settings:
   "Open Anyway" appears there only after a launch attempt has actually been blocked, and
   it stays available for about an hour after the attempt. Click it where it appears next
   to the message about ${APP_NAME}. If you cannot see it where you are, search
   "Open Anyway" in System Settings. It is a one-time step.
3. Grant Microphone and Accessibility when asked. On macOS 27, Accessibility lives
   under System Settings > Device Control and Data Access. Then quit and reopen the app.
    If the menu bar says hotkeys are off but ${APP_NAME} already looks switched on there,
    remove it with the minus button and add it again.
4. Look for the icon in the menu bar. There is no window. Hold control-command to talk,
   release to insert. The menu has Mode, Speech Model and Clean Up Model submenus, each
   naming the choice in use.

Updating:
The app asks GitHub at launch and once a day. When a newer version is out you get one
short notice on screen and the menu grows an "Update available: version X" item that
links to the release page; the icon itself does not change. The app never downloads or
installs anything itself. To update: quit the app, download
the new disk image from the release page, drag the app to Applications to replace the
old one, and reopen. Coming from version 1.0, the old app is named QuickScribe Native,
not ${APP_NAME}: after installing this version, quit QuickScribe Native and drag it to
the Trash, or you will have both apps. Releases share one steady self-made signature,
so an update is the same app to macOS. macOS may still ask for Microphone and Accessibility after an update:
switch them back on if the hotkeys stop working. If a switch already looks on but the
hotkeys are dead, remove ${APP_NAME} from that list with the minus button and add it
again. Coming from version 1.0, which had a throwaway signature, expect to
grant permissions once more whatever you do. If you saved an API key, macOS may ask
for your password after an update so ${APP_NAME} can read it: choose Always Allow.

Your words stay on this Mac unless you set an address in Settings > Inference server.
With an address, the routes you switch in the menu bar (speech, cleanup, or both) go to
that address, plus your API key when the service asks for one. Press Test Connection
there to see how many speech and clean up models it has; choose them from the Speech
Model and Clean Up Model submenus, where Apple Native is always first. With no address,
only Apple Native is offered, and nothing leaves the Mac except the version check at
launch and once a day, which sends only the app name and version; like any web request,
it lets GitHub see your network address.
