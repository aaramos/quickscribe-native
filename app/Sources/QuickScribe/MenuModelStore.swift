///   beside it with a short limit, and its answer replaces the list for the
///   NEXT menu open. A menu that is already open is never changed underneath
///   the person reading it.
/// - A chosen server model that the service no longer lists stays shown, with
///   a note, so the choice is never silently swapped for something else.
